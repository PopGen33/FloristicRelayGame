# FloristicRelayGame: An R package to simulate the "Floristic Relay Game"
*Please* install the package using `devtools::install_github("PopGen33/FloristicRelayGame", build_vignettes = TRUE)`. 
This will install the package and build the vignette that describes how to use the package and provides examples. 
You can view the vignette by  running `devtools::install_github("PopGen33/FloristicRelayGame", build_vignettes = TRUE)`.
Building the vignette requires running 2400 simulations of the floristic relay game, but this usually completes in 
less than one minute. You *can* install without `build_vignettes = TRUE` but this is not recommended.

The original Floristic Relay Game is described on the 
[ESA Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology website](https://tiee.esa.org/vol/v3/experiments/floristic/description.html)
