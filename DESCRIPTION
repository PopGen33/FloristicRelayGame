Description: This is a small R package for simulating the "Floristic Relay Game" described here: <https://www.esa.org/tiee/vol/v3/experiments/floristic/description.html>. 
    It provides functions for creating various parts of the game (gameboard, players, events, plants, etc.) as S7 objects and a function 
    for simulating a game using those objects. It also provides "default" objects (e.g. momerath_herb) described in the game's original 
    description.
